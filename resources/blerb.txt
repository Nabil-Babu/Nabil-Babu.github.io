Hi, my name is Nabil and I am a programmer and artist. 
Over the past few years I have grown in these roles, 
and this website is under construction to better reflect that growth. 
I believe algorithms and patterns can be as beautiful as flowers or paintings. 
I have a profound interest in making procedurally generated content and 
creating dynamic systems with artificial intelligence / life. 
I use these techniques to make video games, art installations, 
websites and anything I find cool. Follow my socials to see 
what I'm up to, or if you want to connect.
