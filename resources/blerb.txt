Hi my name is Nabil, over the past few years, 
I have grown as a software developer and artist. 
This website is under construction to better reflect 
that growth. I think algorithms can be as beautiful as flowers 
or paintings. I take a deep interest in procedural content generation 
and artifical intelligence. I use these techniques to make video games, 
art installations, websites and anything I think is cool. 
Follow my socials if you want to reach out or see what I'm up to.
